where

* $e$ is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms,
* $i$ is the imaginary unit, which by definition satisfies $i^{2} = −1$, and
* $\pi$ is pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

## Euler's Identity

The formula is considered to be an exemplar of vast mathematical beauty.


???
  

* Its beauty arises from its simplicity while expressing highly complex behavior and its profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics.

Stanford University mathematics professor Keith Devlin has said,  

> ...like a Shakespearean sonnet that captures the very essence of love, or a painting that brings out the beauty of the human form that is far more than just skin deep, Euler's equation reaches down into the very depths of existence. [4]

# Golden Ratios


???
  

* What is the golden ratio?

---
## The Golden Ratio

We have a *golden* ratio if the ratio of two quantities is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.

$\frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b}$


???
  

* A ratio describes one quantity in relationship to another one, e.g. how long the width of an image is in relationship to its height. 


--

???
  

* Whether this is a *beautiful* ratio or not is up to personal taste. Be careful though to believe the widespread understanding that the golden ratio is the *natural blueprint* for beauty. There is very little *scientific* evidence for that. You can find ratios similar to the golden ratio in the world, such as in human faces, the Parthenon, etc. but the emphasis is on *similar* and also there are various other prominent ratios out there. With the golden ratio we might have a case of *you find what you are looking for*.

One of the special properties of the Golden Ratio is that *it can be defined in terms of itself*:

--

$1+\frac{1}{\varphi}=\varphi$



---
.header[The Golden Rectangle]

### Derivation of $1+\frac{1}{\varphi}=\varphi$

--

This ratio is defined as $\varphi$:

(1) $\frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \varphi$

--

One method for finding the value of $\varphi$ is to start with the left fraction. 

(2) $\frac{a+b}{a}=\frac{a}{a}+\frac{b}{a} = 1+\frac{b}{a}$

--

We can derive from (1) $\frac{a}{b} = \varphi$ that $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{\varphi}$ and put that into (2)

(3) $1+\frac{b}{a}=1+\frac{1}{\varphi}$

--

Setting that equal to the right side of (1), we get

$1+\frac{1}{\varphi}=\varphi$.

.footnote[[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)]

---
.header[The Golden Rectangle]
## Phi

$\varphi$'s definition with itself leads to a *continued fraction*:

$1+{\cfrac {1}{1+{\cfrac {1}{1+{\cfrac {1}{1+{\cfrac {1}{1+\ddots }}}}}}}}$

--

This is not valid and $\varphi$ can't be expressed as a regular fraction.

---
.header[The Golden Rectangle]
## Phi

A number which can not be constructed from ratios (or fractions) of integers is an *irrational number*.   

--

Their decimal expansions neither terminate nor become periodic.

Rational Number:

$1.5 = \frac{3}{2}$  → *This is a ratio*

--
  
Irrational Number:

$\pi = 3.14159... = \frac{?}{?}$  → *No ratio possible*
  

---
.header[The Golden Rectangle]
## Phi


You can solve $1+\frac{1}{\varphi}=\varphi$ for $\varphi$ algebraically with the quadratic formula to 

--

$\frac{1+{\sqrt{5}}}{2} = 1.618\,033\,988\,7\dots$  
  

???
  

Multiplying by φ  gives
φ + 1 = φ^2 
which can be rearranged to
φ^2 − φ − 1 = 0

* Because $\varphi$ is the ratio between positive quantities, $\varphi$ is necessarily positive
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio

In summary, we can represent $\varphi$ as

* At the n-th step we'd have zn=pnqn, which means, counting from 0, that the qn-th branch coincides with the 0-th and that we've done pn turns around the center.

* The digits of $\pi$ are uniformly randomly distributed, meaning that its digits 0 through 9 appear equally often, as do pairs of digits, trios of digits, and so forth. If you don't believe it you can count digits in its first [10 million decimal places](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/pi-10million.txt).
* The digits of $\pi$ pass every test for randomness, yet $\pi$ is a precise mathematical value that describes the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter. This dichotomy between *very random* and *very structured* blows my mind. [[20]](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2015/03/12/digits-of-pi.html#prettyPhoto)

* In honor of $\pi$ day, which is on March, 14th according to the north american date formating of 03.14., several artists visually represent $\pi$ each year anew in a creative and beautiful manner.
* http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/
* Here, the digits of $\pi$ are represented as a path traced by links between successive digits. Each digit is assigned a segment around the circle and a link between segment $i$ and $j$ corresponds to the appearance of $ij$ in $\pi$. For example, the $14$ in $3.14...$ is drawn as a link between segment $1$ and segment $4$. [[21]](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/art/method.mhtml)

* Wenn man sich die Figur genau ansieht, kann man erkennen, dass an der Stelle (−¾, 0) ein einzelner Punkt zu sein scheint, der zwei Bereiche der Mandelbrotmenge scharf voneinander trennt. Das wollte der Informatikstudent Dave Boll im Jahr 1991 genauer untersuchen. Dafür betrachtete er winzige Abweichungen von dieser Stelle (etwa den Punkt (–¾, 0,001)) und berechnete, wie viele Wiederholungen n man braucht, bis der Wert von zn zwei übersteigt. (Man wählt häufig die – willkürlich festgelegte – Zahl 2, weil die rekursive Gleichung beim Erreichen dieses Werts ganz sicher nicht mehr beschränkt ist.) Als Boll verschiedene Abweichungen der Größe 0,1; 0,01; 0,001 und so weiter von dem Punkt (–¾, 0) untersuchte, erlebte er eine Überraschung:
* Je näher der Wert an den interessanten Punkt rückt, desto mehr Nachkommastellen von Pi entfalten sich in n. Damit hatte Boll nicht gerechnet – ebenso wenig wie die Mathematikerinnen und Mathematiker, die er damit konfrontierte. Doch bevor er mit einem Erklärungsversuch aufwartete, sah er sich zunächst einen anderen Punkt der Mandelbrotmenge an: den »Hintern« des Apfelmännchens mit den Koordinaten (¼, 0). Er wollte herausfinden, ob Pi auch dort auftaucht. Als er die gleiche Analyse an der neuen Stelle durchführte, erhielt er folgende Zahlenreihe:
* Wieder schien die Folge gegen die Nachkommastellen von Pi zu streben – wenn auch langsamer als zuvor. Wie sich herausstellte, gibt es weitere Punkte in der Mandelbrotmenge, an denen man Pi auf ähnliche Weise konstruieren kann. Um herauszufinden, wo die Kreiszahl herkommt, muss man die Werte der iterativen Gleichung, der das fraktale Muster zu Grunde liegt, untersuchen. Denn in ihnen versteckt sich eine trigonometrische Funktion, die π an diesen völlig unerwarteten Stellen erzeugt.
* Wir hatten bereits gesehen, dass die iterative Funktion für c = ¼ (also der Hintern des Apfelmännchens) niemals Werte annimmt, die größer sind als ½. Die Zahlen nähern sich zwar immer weiter ½ an, je häufiger man sie in die Gleichung einsetzt, doch ohne den Wert jemals zu erreichen. Setzt man nun statt ¼ c = 0,26 in die iterative Gleichung ein, erhält man folgende (gerundete) Zahlenfolge: 0,26; 0,328; 0,367; 0,395; 0,416; 0,433; 0,448; 0,46; 0,472; 0,483, 0,493; 0,503; 0,513; 0,523; 0,534; 0,545; 0,557; 0,57; 0,585; 0,602; 0,623; 0,648; 0,68; 0,722; 0,781; 0,87; 1,017; 1,294; 1,934; 3,999; 16,251; … Anfangs wachsen die Werte nur sehr langsam an, bis sie schließlich explosionsartig ansteigen.

# Curves


???
  

* Next to spirals as curve designs, there are several similarly simple functions that create aesthetically pleasing curves. At first sight, the Wikipedia and Wolfram pages of these functions can appear a bit intimidating. But I would like to show you that it is actually not that hard to get a grip on these functions.

Let's have a look into the rose curve.

## The Rose Curve

What does [wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Rose_(mathematics) say?

What does [Wolfram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RoseCurve.html) say?


???
  

* This page is still somewhat simple and well-arranged. Sometimes these pages overflow with explanations, different representations, history and proofs, etc.. Fear not! What you always want to look out for is the *coordinates* you can plot, be it polar or cartesian coordinates (we know how to go from one to the other so it does not really matter what we get).

**What is the Polar Coordinate System? **
* In mathematics, the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction.

![polar_01](../02_scripts/img/03/polar_01.png)  
[[wiki]](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Ebene_polarkoordinaten.svg)

(here with $\phi$ as name for the angular coordinate, often called the polar angle)

Hence,  
  
$x = r \cos{\phi}$  
$y = r \sin{\phi}$

and

$r = \sqrt{{x^2 + y^2}}$  
$\phi = \tan^{-1}{\left (\frac{y}{x}\right )}$

Polar coordinates are most appropriate in any context where the phenomenon being considered is inherently tied to *direction* and *length* from a *center point*, such as with spirals. Please make sure that you know what polar coordinates are and how to use them. We are going to need them all the time.

Rose curves are defined by 

$r = a \cos(k\theta)$

with the angular frequency of $k$ and an amplitude of $a$.

$y=\cos(k\theta )\sin(\theta )$

* k petals if k is odd.


* Nice, we want that controllability for our rose, so let's add that to the code and compute the (cartesian) coordinates. All code snippets here are optimized for readability and understanding - some things could be implemented more efficiently, e.g. computing `cos(k*theta)` twice...

* But wiki is not really clear about how many loops we need. Now we have two options: 1. read the wiki page in detail to gain a better understanding or 2. find another resource which gives us the infos we are looking for more directly. As I am lazy, I go for option 2 and my second place to look at for maths is usually Wolfram.

And, we are successful! [Wolfram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rose.html) says on first sight something about *closing the curve*: 

> If $n=r/s$ is a rational number, then the curve closes at a polar angle of $\theta=\pi s p$, where $p=1$ if $rs$ is odd and $p=2$ if rs is even.

Unfortunately, and this happens usually when you use multiple resources, the parameter are named differently. But, we can easily translate them by setting n = k, r = n, s = d

* Iterate over the numbers, multiply by 2 -> Number to multiply is the other parameter)
    * 0*2 = 0
    * 1*2 = 2
    * 2*2 = 4
    * 2*3 = 6
    * For results > the number of points, we take the modulo with the number of points
        * E.g. 10 points on the circle
        * Multiplier 2 for point 7 = 14
        * 14 modulo 10 = 4
